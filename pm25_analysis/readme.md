# Beijing Pollution and Weather Anomaly Detection using LSTM
 
This is a project I am working on during my free time applying some of the techniques I learned working at my current job as a data scientist. The goal of this project is to take the publically available Beijing weather data from 2010 to 2015 and apply anomaly detection techniques to see if we can discover weather and pollution extreme events without any labels. We can later verify the quality and performance of the model by investigating the time period that the model labels as anomalies. Similar techniques can be applied to other time series dataset.
